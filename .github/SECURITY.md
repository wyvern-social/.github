# Security Policy

## Overview

Wyvern takes security seriously. Responsible reporting of vulnerabilities that may impact user safety, data integrity, or system availability is essential.

## In-Scope Issues

Report vulnerabilities that affect the Wyvern ecosystem, including:

- Server-side issues that could allow privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration.
- Client-side vulnerabilities enabling remote code execution or exposure of sensitive data.
- API flaws that bypass authentication or expose protected resources.
- Misconfigurations resulting in security-impacting behavior.

## Out-of-Scope Issues

Do not report issues that:

- Require physical access to a device.
- Only affect visual permissions or appearance without impacting server authority.
- Depend on third-party sites or social engineering to obtain user credentials.
- Are caused by outdated or unsupported platforms or browsers.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

- Relevant code references if available.
- Environment details (API version, commit hash, configuration context).
- Potential impact or exploitation scenarios.
